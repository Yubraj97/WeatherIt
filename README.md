**Weather It** is a web based application made using HTML, JS, CSS ,PHP and MYSQL.<br>
It fetches weather data from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and parses it on json form and displays it on the web.<br>
It retrieves required data for the address given by the user.It uses JS asynchronous functions and concepts like await, 
try and catch , arrays and html data manipulation through JS itself.<br>
I have used TABLE based layout for easier styling and layouting . I have used MySQL and PHP for database and backend.
